Hi there!

I am cleaning and refactoring the code of LOGAN. I will release it here soon. 

Sorry for that I wasn't able to start working on this earlier.

If you need the code for comparison experiments in your CVPR submission, please do not hesitate to send me an email. I will share with you the (messy) version of the code we used for siggraph asia submission. It contains zombie modules/variables, but it is easy to run.
